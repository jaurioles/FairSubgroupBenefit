This repository is attached to the manuscript "Understanding algorithmic fairness 
for clinical prediction in terms of subgroup net benefit and health equity".

The goal of this repository is to show how the results reported in the manuscript
were obtained. Because UK Biobank data cannot be shared freely, the code is not
fully reproducible, but a synthetic data example is included. Here is an overview
of the files:

1_data_preprocessing.R - This R file prepares the 'raw' UK Biobank data. As
            UK Biobank data cannot be provided, we have included an alternative
            file "1_1_synthetic.R" that creates a similar-looking dataset to run
            the code on.
          
1_1_synthetic.R - Creates a similar-looking synthetic dataset to run the code on.
            The data is not meant to be realistic, just structurally similar, so that
            the provided code can be run somewhere. The outcome in both the diabetes 
            and lung cancer cases follows a very simple, slightly non-linear logistic regression.

2_model_training.R - Trains the XGboost models using the training part of the
            training:validation split.

3_boot_validation.R - Generates validation results for the LASSO logistic regression models.

4_1_split_validation.R - Uses XGBoost models trained in "2_model_training.R" to
            plot all the results related to the xgboost model.

4_2_boot_validation.R - Uses validation results from "3_boot_validation.R" to plot all the results
            related to the LASSO models.

This code was run with R.4.4.1.
